  This notebook introduces the [Fine-Tuning Scheduler](https://finetuning-scheduler.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) extension
  and demonstrates the use of it to fine-tune a small foundation model on the
  [RTE](https://huggingface.co/datasets/viewer/?dataset=super_glue&config=rte) task of
  [SuperGLUE](https://super.gluebenchmark.com/) with iterative early-stopping defined according to a user-specified
  schedule. It uses Hugging Face's ``datasets`` and ``transformers`` libraries to retrieve the relevant benchmark data
  and foundation model weights. The required dependencies are installed via the finetuning-scheduler ``[examples]`` extra.
